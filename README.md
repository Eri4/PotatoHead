Personal project for generating at the moment news content with animation and ai, it generates frames that depend on the commentary(which we get with openai api, from the news storey). Also using elevenlabs to make the voice. 

Future considerations: 
Not sure, this was just a cool idea i had, i may expand on the animation part and make it a completely interactable service, so we can pass assets and so generated animation as we need. (Not sure how to make more complex animation work tho haha)

If anyone want to use this, go ahead, just that it is a bit of a mess, as it is just a hobby project. Also i am not explaining all the features here to tell the truth. so just get in the code.
