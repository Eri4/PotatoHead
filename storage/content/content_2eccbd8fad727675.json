  "rawText": "Ladies and gentlemen, in breaking news, Judy Collins is remembering her glory days of belting out protest songs during the Vietnam War. Yes, nothing says \"let's end a war\" quite like a folksy tune strummed on a guitar. Because if there's one thing that convinces world leaders to call it quits, it's some sweet harmonies and a catchy chorus, right? \n\nSo, if you’re in the mood for a nostalgia trip mixed with a side of societal upheaval, grab your acoustic guitar and prepare to be mildly inspired. Don’t forget to like and subscribe for more thrilling updates on how music can change the world—or at least make us tap our feet. \n\nThis has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
