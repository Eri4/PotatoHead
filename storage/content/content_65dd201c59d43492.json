  "rawText": "In breaking news, folks, the stars have spoken, and apparently, they’re not thrilled with your shopping choices this Saturday. That's right, if you were thinking about hitting the mall post-11 a.m., you might want to reconsider—unless you enjoy arguments with your children, of course. The moon is in Aries, which I assume means it’s time to throw caution to the wind and buy that neon green tracksuit you don't need. \n\nSo, if you want to avoid a celestial catastrophe, just remember: when in doubt, blame the moon. Like, subscribe, and follow for more astrological wisdom that probably won’t change your life, but hey, it sure is entertaining! This has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
