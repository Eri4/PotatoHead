  "rawText": "Ladies and gentlemen, in breaking news, it seems like the team behind “American Psycho” is ready to toss their hats into the ring now that Luca Guadagnino is planning to give us another cinematic makeover. Because, you know, what better way to celebrate a quarter-century of existential dread than to hand it over to someone who specializes in beautiful visuals and questionable character decisions? They’re absolutely *thrilled*—or at least as thrilled as one can be when handing over their legacy to someone else. \n\nSo buckle up, folks; it looks like we might just get a film that's stylish but utterly devoid of the original's charm! Don’t forget to like, subscribe, or follow this riveting journey through cinematic chaos. \n\nThis has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
