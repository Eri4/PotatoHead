  "rawText": "In breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, it appears Michelle Pfeiffer is tossing her perfectly coiffed hair back in concern over Los Angeles losing its status as an industry town. Who knew the solution to Hollywood’s woes was just a few tax incentives away? Maybe they should start handing them out like candy at a parade; just imagine the candy wrappers littering the streets! \n\nAnd yes, while she's filming a series about money problems with Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning, one can’t help but wonder if the real problem is that Hollywood forgot how to balance its budget. Just what we need – another adaptation of a bestseller filled with rich folks complaining about their money issues. \n\nSo, if you find this riveting, make sure to like and subscribe for more delightful insights. This has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
