  "rawText": "Ladies and gentlemen, in a plot twist that no one saw coming—because really, who was waiting for a sequel to ‘The Accountant’—we’ve got news that Anna Kendrick is “a hundred percent in” for a third installment. That’s right, folks. Apparently, Hollywood thinks accountants need more sequels than a certain fast car franchise. \n\nSo, get ready for more math and mayhem, and maybe a few musical numbers thrown in for good measure. Because nothing says action like crunching numbers and, oh, I don’t know, watching two guys argue over spreadsheets. \n\nMake sure to like, subscribe, or whatever else you do to keep up with this rollercoaster of mediocrity. This has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
