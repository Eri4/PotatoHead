  "rawText": "In breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, it seems Sean Combs' former chief of staff is caught up in a delightful trilogy of lawsuits, accusing him of providing a little too much assistance to Mr. Combs' alleged extracurricular activities. Because when you think \"team player,\" you definitely want to imagine someone facilitating sex abuseâ€”what a resume booster!\n\nJust a day after Combs and his ex-girlfriend reached a settlement that we can safely assume has more fine print than a used car contract, he's already back to sunbathing in Miami. Now that's what I call a quick recovery. So, folks, if you enjoyed this riveting saga of celebrity chaos, do us all a favor and like this video, subscribe for more juicy updates, and remember: you can't spell \"scandal\" without \"can.\" \n\nThis has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
