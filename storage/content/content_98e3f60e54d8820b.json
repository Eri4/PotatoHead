  "rawText": "Ladies and gentlemen, in breaking news that will surely change the fabric of reality as we know it, we have an astrological warning for April 26, 2025. Apparently, after 11 a.m. in Chicago, it’s best to avoid making any important decisions or, heaven forbid, doing any shopping. Because nothing screams “sound judgment” like letting the whims of a celestial body dictate your life choices. \n\nAnd for our Aries friends, it looks like you might just want to put a little distance between yourself and the nearest child—because arguing with them while the moon is in your sign is definitely the recipe for familial bliss. Remember, folks, astrology: the oldest form of excuse-making known to humankind.\n\nSo, if you love reading the stars more than your morning coffee, go ahead and like, subscribe, and follow for more insights you never knew you needed. This has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
