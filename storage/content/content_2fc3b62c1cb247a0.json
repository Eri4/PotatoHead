  "rawText": "In breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, grab your tie-dye shirts and peace signs, because we're taking a nostalgic trip back to the 60s and 70s – a time when protest songs were as common as avocado toast in a hipster café. Judy Collins, the original folk diva, is reminiscing about belting out Bob Dylan's hits in front of thousands of protestors during the Vietnam War. Ah yes, because nothing says \"stop the war\" quite like strumming a guitar while everyone else is dodging bullets!\n\nSo, if you’re itching to relive that era of political angst and melodious rebellion, consider following along. And remember, folks, like and subscribe to keep your nostalgia fresh. This has been PotatoHead, wasting your time as usual.",
